## About Me

IT Educator with a solid foundation in cybersecurity and networking, currently transitioning into a **Junior Cybersecurity / SOC-oriented role**.

I have completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and multiple institutional training programs at **ITLA**, building practical knowledge in security fundamentals, threat analysis, risk management, incident response basics, Linux, SQL, and network security concepts.

I am currently enrolled in the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** program, strengthening my networking skills as a key pillar for defensive security and SOC environments. My short-term goal includes obtaining **CompTIA Security+**, while my long-term academic plan may include a **Master’s degree in Cybersecurity**.

My background in education has strengthened my ability to document processes, communicate technical concepts clearly, and work with structured methodologies—skills directly applicable to security operations and entry-level SOC environments.

I am seeking a **Junior Cybersecurity or SOC Analyst role** where I can continue learning, contribute responsibly, and grow within a security-focused team.
